<h1>The Civil War, Literature's Demise, & Firemen's Role Change</h1>
	</div>
<p> The start of literature's downfall begun shortly before the 2000s. However, the actions against books started in the early 2020s. Prior to the late twentieth century, the majority of books were used to record and share ancient historical moments, as well as the stories of the world's societies. However, in 1982, extremist cults began primarily using books as a way to spread their hateful ideologies. As technologies advanced away from printed to digital text, books were almost exclusively used to spread the hate speech of these groups. In 2000, several cult factions joined together to revolt against the government. The conflicts began with attacks on small rural communities. These terrorists would target both civilians and military personnel. Over the next year, these attacks escalated. The worst attack was on the World Trade Center in September of 2001. This attack resulted in the deaths of thousands of American citizens and led to an escalation of the war campaign against the cult extremists. Over the next 15 years, the civil war tore apart society as the casualties of the conflicts continue to rise. As the fighting progressed, the extremists were continually weakened. In 2017, the cults were almost completely wiped-out except for a few small cells. The military continued to hunt down these groups until they were eradicated.         </p>

<p>Books played a massive role in spreading these cult's messages of hate. During the civil war, the government attempted to stop the release of the extremist groups books but were blocked by the Supreme Court, citing the First Amendment. The First Amendment was a rule created centuries before the events of the Civil War. The rule made it so the government could not block the release of literature. While that may have benefited society in the past, by the twenty-first century, all it achieved was allowing for the release of literature that would cause hatred and violence. Even after the war was over, these extremist groups continued to write hateful literature in an attempt to incite violence. In response to this, the government ended the First Amendment in 2024 in order to end the creation of these texts. This went a long way to stop the creation of new books by these cults, but the books they had made in the past were still easy to obtain. So in 2027, the possession and distribution of printed literature was made illegal under the Hall-Booth Act. The law was named after the two congressmen who originally created it. While this law led to a decrease in the ownership and use of books, it also caused the creation of a black market for literature. It became clear that simply making books illegal would not stop them from being able to spread their hatred. Even worse, extremists were uploading the texts to the Internet so they could be spread more easily. The government knew that they had to actively seek out and destroy these books. This would be no simple task, as there were hundreds of millions of books in the United States. In 2030, President Meridian instituted the War on Books. The mission of this policy was to destroy every book in the country. The strategist assigned to this program knew that this task would require a large amount of resources and would likely need to be run mostly at the local level. The decision was to have local fire departments, under the supervision of the newly formed National Literature Enforcement Bureau (NLEB), handle the destruction of books.</p>
	
	<p>The roles of firemen have changed drastically over the past century. There was once a time when the fireproofing technologies of today did not exist. Buildings and wildlife would often catch fire, and when they did, the results could be disastrous. Therefore, specially trained personnel were needed to put out these fires and rescue those who were put in danger by the flames. This was the job of the firemen. Overtime, fireproofing technologies continued to advance and fire departments were needed less and less. By the late 2020s, firemen rarely had to actually put out fires. Many jurisdictions were even considering disbanding their fire departments all together. When the War on Books was enacted, the NLEB saw the potential of using the fire departments to achieve the goal of destroying all of the remaining books. So with funding from the Federal Government, the firemen of the nation were retrained to learn of the use controlled burns to destroy the books. The fire departments were also given the ability to punish the extremist who had books in their possession. Local firemen have been the front line force in the fight against literature and will continue to bravely serve their communities by protecting them from the evil that books contain.</p>
